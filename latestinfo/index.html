<p class="h5 fw-bold style="margin-top: 60px;">Final Announcement (January 20, 2025)</p>
<p>AIDEA is approaching, and we are already looking forward to exciting presentations and discussions with you! Researchers and practitioners from eight countries are invited to present their work, engage in discussions on key issues, and begin collaborative projects.</p>
<p>The structure of the scientific program will be a mixture of formal and informal sessions, small group and whole group discussions, keynote (45 minutes) and regular (20 minutes) presentations, workshops and a panel discussion.</p>
<p><b>The Scientific Program</b><br>
The working language of the Symposium is English. The activities of the scientific program include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Invited keynotes (45+15 minutes),</li>
        <li>Daily opening sessions for reflection on the presentations and discussion of the previous day (30 minutes),</li>
        <li>Two parallel strands of regular presentations (20+10 minutes each), combined with daily small group discussions (45 minutes) facilitated by several small-group-moderators</li>
        <li>Two workshops to get first-hand experiences with DS & AI materials and tools</li>
        <li>Panel discussion by Rolf Biehler, Carsten Schulte, Sue Sentence, Dan Verständig, and Michelle Wilkerson</li>
        <li>A whole group discussion on the closing day</li>
    </ul>
<p>This structure gives each presenter a chance to share their research while allowing the group to discuss the findings and engage in meaningful interaction.</p>
<p><b>Program and Moderation of the Sessions:</b><br>
    The program has been finalized and can be found at <a href="https://aidea2025.github.io/schedule/timetable/">https://aidea2025.github.io/schedule/timetable/</a>.
    We have now also assigned the participants as chairs of the various sessions. The assignment can  be found in the program.</p>
  <h6>Tasks as session chair (keynote and regular presentations):</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Most important: Keep an eye on the timetable.</li>
        <li>Briefly announce the presentations. It is sufficient to announce the name of the speaker and title of the presentation. Moderate the discussions after the presentations.</li>
        <li>All speakers, please introduce yourselves briefly at the beginning of your presentation.</li>
    </ul>
<h6>Tasks as small group discussion moderator:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Moderate the small group discussion</li>
        <li>Make sure, every member of your group gets the opportunity to make a contribution</li>
        <li>Make sure that somebody takes notes (for the recap of the day on the next day)</li>
    </ul>
<h6>Tasks as session chair (morning recap of the previous day):</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Invite 2-3 small groups to present their findings (max. 5 minutes per group)</li>
        <li>Moderate the following group discussion</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the timetable</li>
    </ul>

<p>
<b>Submission of abstracts:</b>
<p>The deadline for abstract submission has been extended to August 23, 2024.</p>

The rooms must be booked individually and initially paid for by the participants themselves.
After the symposium, we will reimburse the maximum costs of 445€ if you have indicated that you are requesting a refund (5 nights at 89€ each, including breakfast).
Double rooms can also be booked if you would like to bring an accompanying person. A double room costs 104€ per night. We are only able to provide a refund up to the amount of the single room (89€/night). If you wish to arrive earlier or depart later, please clarify this individually with the hotel.
You can cancel your reservation free of charge until February 1st, 2025. After that, 90% of the full price will be due, which we unfortunately cannot refund in the event of a no-show.</p>
<p>Booking is possible by <a href="mailto:reservations.salzburg@leonardo-hotels.com">email</a>. Please enter the keyword communicated via email when booking and complete the booking by October 31, 2024 at the latest.</p>
<p><b>Travel costs:</b></p>
<p>Each participant must book the trip individually. Travel costs will be reimbursed after the symposium up to the specified upper limits (provided you have indicated that you are making use of the funding).</p>
